# Hi ! 👋 Happy to see you visiting my Homelab project

## What is this about? 🧐
   This is a repository dedicated to documenting my journey with homelabing and general networking. I will upload the configuration files of my network hardware as well as servers configs and scripts if any will be made. 

## Start of the project
   I was interested in tech for kind of a long time. But never really did anything serious at my home apart from custom ROMing a couple of old samsung smartphones, until.. </br>
   Around the summer vacations I saw how big oppurtunities I had for creating a lab in my home. I have a big room and I have access to fast internet. Around the middle of October of 2024 I did my first step to creating a homelab. I bought two Dell PowerEdge servers: a R610 and a R710. </br>
   I learned some simple things about Proxmox Virtual Enviroment and realized how much potential it had. So I installed it on my R710. I created some simple VMs such as a Win11 or Ubuntu Server for a Minecraft Server.

## The goal 📈
   The current goal of this project is to simply learn by practically experimenting with physical hardware for my dream of working in network engineering in the future.
