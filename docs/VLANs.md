## VLANs

Okay so I would like to segment my network in the following way:
- VLAN ID is relevant to the x in this LAN IP address: 10.0.x.0


- VLAN 10 - PCs, laptops, game consoles 
- VLAN 20 - Servers
- VLAN 30 - VMs
- VLAN 35 - CTs
- VLAN 40 - Surveilance cameras
- VLAN 50 - Probably Wi-Fi for guests
- VLAN 99 - All network devices as well as my ThinkPad because I do not want to do Inter-vlan routing between this VLAN and any other
