## January 2025

As for now, I am waiting for a rack. I think I will make one myself or just buy one from junkyard. Thats all for now. 
I haven't got time lately for doing abything with my homelab because I have been making projects for HackClub High Seas Event. Those projects take a lot of time so after it ends I will get back to my homelab.
